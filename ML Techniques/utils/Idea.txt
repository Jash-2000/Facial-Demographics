#Gabor Filter
A Gabor filter encodes edges. While constructing the filter you can specify the orientation of the edges it will be sensitive to. 
Convolving an image with a filter bank of gabors, where each is sensitive to a different orientation and scale, generates multiple 
responses for all elements in the image that indicate the local orientations of the edges. Gabor filters let you encode the image 
into local orientations.

Gabor filters are a common model of simple cells found in the early stages of the visual cortex. Simple cells respond to the 
presence of oriented edges in the visual stimulus.

# Image correction
-> For grey Images, histogram would be equalized and then the adaptive thresholding and sobel would be applied.
-> For coloured Images, Gamma correction would take place only after their Value histogram is plotted.



#Custom Ensamble layers: 

- > Using the classification + regression method
Insight -  During the time of training, (Consider KNN model is used) The model will divide the train data into different labels.
               Now, for each label, seperate SVR will be trained and finally outcome would be provided.

-> Weighted Voting Classifier at grid search level and Naive bias level 

-> All the different models will be bagged (voting classifier)

-> Grey scaled image and Coloured image will first be stacked and then Linear regression will find their final output.
